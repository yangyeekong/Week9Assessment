1. Connect to this endpoint: https://api.nationalize.io/?name=nathaniel
2. Make a GET request to retrieve data.
3. Parse the JSON response and extract the field: “name”
4. Add Error Handling (e.g., print(“Error code:)).”
5. Store your API base URL in an `.env` file and ensure `.gitignore` excludes it.
6. For submission commit and push task3.py file to Github
